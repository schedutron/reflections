Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Answer:
When I initialize a git repo, a hidden directory named ".git" gets saved in my repo. This directory is used to store the
metadata associated with this repo, like commit history. I need to initialize a repo so that I can start keeping track
of the files in my repo; so that I have version control over my repository.
