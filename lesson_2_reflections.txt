Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Answer:
When I initialize a git repo, a hidden directory named ".git" gets saved in my repo. This directory is used to store the
metadata associated with this repo, like commit history. I need to initialize a repo so that I can start keeping track
of the files in my repo; so that I have version control over my repository.

Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Answer:
Working directory contains files which are both being tracked and not being tracked. It's just a usual directory. Staging
area contains only those files which are to be tracked. It contains only those files which you specify to be tracked. It
is useful because you don't want to always track all your files in your repo. In other words, the staging area contains
those files which together fit a specific commit. In contrast to this, a repository contains just commits. A repository
is but a series of commits, with the most recent commit being visible to the human eye, whereas the previous commits
become part of the repo's history metadata.
